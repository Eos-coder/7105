red queen
pessoas falam que uns são heróis e vilões brbrmas único ser que pode julgar se é um vilão ou um herói é senhor brbrque não só se sacrificou pelo mundo mas por cada cidadão que ele ama brum vilão pode ser destruído e se tornar um heróifazendo coisas que vezes nem próprio herói conseguiria fazer bre vezes os que são considerados heróis fazem coisas horríveis que os tornam vilões brapenas único que consegue ser um herói sem ser um pouco vilão é deus brbrporque nós somos humanos e erramos todos os dias por isso não somos nem heróis nem vilõesbr brmas gosto dos livros porque vezes os que são chamados de vilões só precisam de amor e carinho pra se transformarem heróis
